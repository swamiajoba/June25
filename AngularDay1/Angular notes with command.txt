TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

What is an Angular?
Angular is a typescript based framework using 
which we can develop Single Page Application(SPA ).
It is developed by Google.

It is used to develop single pgae application in which
the entire page will not be refreshed rather the part of
page or screen is refreshed along with url.

We require node.js and npm to be installed.
npm -> node package manager.

When we install node.js , at that time it installs
npm also. 

to check is type command

C:\Users\manji>node --version
v23.11.0

C:\Users\manji>npm --version
10.9.2

To develop angular application we use 
Microsoft Visual Studio Code editor.

To create a angular project we type command 

D:\Mphasis_June_25\AngularDemos>
         npx -p @angular/cli@15 ng new webapp1

To run the application type command

D:\Mphasis_June_25\AngularDemos>cd webapp1

D:\Mphasis_June_25\AngularDemos\webapp1>npx ng serve


Files and folder structure in webapp1

1.	tsconfig.app.json  
	tsconfig.json
	=> typescript configuration  for angular app

	tsconfig.spec.json
	=> typescript testing 

2.	package.json
	=> it  have dependencies along with version 
	required for angular project app

	package-lock.json
	=> it is showing those dependencies which are 
	installed and locked

3. 	angular.json
	=> it consist of angular project configuration

	it shows which is first file executed
	ie src/index.html

	it shows which is first typescript will be loaded
	and executed
	ie src/main.ts


4. 	src/index.html -> first file to show on browser
	src/main.ts -> first file loaded and executed
	src/styles.css -> global css for angular project

5. 	src/app --> It consist of angular component
	main component is AppComponent

6.	src/app/app.module.ts 
	=> it consist of list of angular components ,
	pipes, services , modules , router module,
	directives ......
	what is there in angular project and who is
	the first component loaded in browser

Every component has 4 files
for eg AppComponent has four files

23-06-2025  11:22                 0 app.component.css
23-06-2025  11:22            23,115 app.component.html
23-06-2025  11:22             1,076 app.component.spec.ts
23-06-2025  11:22               211 app.component.ts

What is bootstrapping in angular?
	=> It is process of initializing and loading
	angular web application

	1. starts from index.html -> this is a first page 
	loads in the browser

	2.  loads all the libraries mentioned in 	package.json

	3. initialize angular.json
	It shows which is the first file
	in browser index.html
	in app main.ts

	4. loads and executes main.ts->which is the first 	module to load . by Defualt AppModule is the 
	first module

	5. AppModule is loaded and executed
	file is app.module.ts
	In this , it shows first component to be executed
	by default AppComponent is exected

	6. This AppComponent is loaded displayed in 	index.html it uses tag <app-root>


To generate component command is
	-> npx ng g c home
	g for generate
	c for component
	home for name of the component
