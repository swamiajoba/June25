In Angular there are two types of forms .
1. Template driven form - In this form and its validation is
	done in the template
2. Reactive form - In this, form control and its validation is 
	managed by component. Also called as model driven form

To generate template driven form generate a project
	-> npx -p @angular/cli@15 ng new webapp3
Install bootstrap
	-> npm install bootstrap@5 --save
Generate a component
	-> npx ng g c template-driven

Generate a class
	-> npx ng g class model/contact

Generate a directive for validation and implements Validator interface
	-> npx ng g directive directive/match-password

For validation logic generate a class
	-> npx ng g class utils/tvalidation

====================================================

For reactive forutm generate following thing
	Generate custom validator class
	-> npx ng g class utils/validation

	Generate a component 
	-> npx ng g c reactive-form
